Certainly! Below are step-by-step instructions to set up a development environment using Visual Studio Code Dev Containers:

### Step 1: Install Prerequisites

Ensure that you have the necessary software installed on your machine:

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)

### Step 2: Open Project in VS Code

Open Visual Studio Code and navigate to the project folder:

```bash
cd <project-folder>
code .
```

### Step 3: Install "Remote - Containers" Extension

In Visual Studio Code, go to the Extensions view (shortcut: `Ctrl+Shift+X`), search for "Remote Development and Dev Containers," and install the extension provided by Microsoft.

### Step 5: Reopen Project in Dev Container

Press `Ctrl+Shift+P`, type "Dev Containers: Reopen in container," and select this option. This command reloads the project in a containerized development environment.

### Step 6: Verify Dev Container Setup

Open a terminal in VS Code; you should find yourself inside the development container. Confirm that the required dependencies are installed, and the project runs successfully.

### Step 7: Run the Application

Proceed with the development of your application within the container.

These steps help streamline the development process by isolating dependencies within a container, ensuring consistent environments across different development machines.
